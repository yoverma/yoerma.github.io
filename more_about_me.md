##  Moi! Welcome to my webpage.

I earned my Integrated B.S. - M.S. in Physics and Data Science from [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). I have done several internships on intersection of Machine Learning and Experimental High Energy Physics at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in [CMS Experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) ,[EPP lab, UZH](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/kilminster.html) with Yuta, Arne, Stefanos and Izaak , [PPSP, IFJ PAN](https://www.ifj.edu.pl/) with Rafa≈Ç Staszewski and Marcin Wolter, and [IAS,Kolkata](https://www.ias.ac.in/) with Ritesh K. Singh. 


I have a relatively diverse research background, as you may have noticed from my research internship experience. I started my Machine Learning journey from _Physics_ strengthning the mathematical foundations, then to _combining_ both in search for [superlative performance](https://www.pnnl.gov/explainer-articles/physics-informed-machine-learning), and then to _physics inspired geometrical deep learning_ on graphs especially applied to [track particles in particle colliders](https://news.fnal.gov/2020/09/the-next-big-thing-the-use-of-graph-neural-networks-to-discover-particles/) like CERN. After my eventfull journey in Physics, I transitioned into _machine learning_, and currently working on formulating improved methodologies for applications in Science. 

I'm currently living in [Helsinki](./Helsinki.png).
