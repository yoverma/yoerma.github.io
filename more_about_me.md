##  Moi! Welcome to my webpage.

I earned my MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and BSc in Statistics from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). I have worked for [Invenia Lab, Cambridge](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/) with Francesco Caravelli, and [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.is.cas.cn/), with Mingxue Liao and Pin Lv.

I have a relatively diverse research background, as you may have noticed from my publications. I started my Data Science journey from _Bayesian_, then to [_Frequentist_](https://xkcd.com/1132/), then to _complexity system_, then to _reinforcement learning_, then to _neural nets_, then to _computer vision_, and then back to [_Bayesian_](https://www.inference.vc/everything-that-works-works-because-its-bayesian-2/). 

I'm currently living in [Helsinki](./Helsinki.jpg).
